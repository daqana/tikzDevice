Description: The tikzDevice package provides a graphics output device for R
    that records plots in a LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms
    plotting commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When
    included in a paper typeset by LaTeX, these blocks are interpreted with the
    help of TikZ---a graphics package for TeX and friends written by Till
    Tantau. Using the tikzDevice, the text of R plots can contain LaTeX
    commands such as mathematical formula. The device also allows arbitrary
    LaTeX code to be inserted into the output stream.
